# hackNC 2016 Team Project: Trashphalt

## What's the problem we are solving?

Local infrastructure problems are not reported efficiently to the Chapel Hill city government.

## How are we solving it?

We built a system for citizens to report potholes through a simple web submission form with drop pins on a local street map.

### Components:

Esri ArcGIS API
Bootstrap
